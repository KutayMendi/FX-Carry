How to run
-----
1) Put data csvs in `data/`
2) `pythom run_backtests.py`
3) Look at the metric returned and a plot in `output/`

Data
- data/fx.csv: the daily close levels where columns are currencies quoted as xxxUSD
- data/rates.csv: monthly policy/short rates, with columns as currencies

Just a quick note: both files need to have a date column in the format YYYY-MM-DD
